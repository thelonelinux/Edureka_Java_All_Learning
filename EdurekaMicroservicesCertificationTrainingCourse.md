# Edureka Microservices Certification Training Course

## Course Content: (Total 8 Modules, Sessions of 3 hours each)
### 1. Introduction to Microservices
* Class 1 Recording Learning
* Pre-requisites: Java
* So To Implement Microservices Architecture in our Project: We will be using the following tech Stacks
  * We will be doing practicals in Java and SpringBoot Framework (Basics of Core Java, Basics of Spring Framework like IOC Dependency Injection)
  * We will be dealing with RestFUL Web Services (Which will be using SpringBoot which in turn uses Spring MVC only)
  * SpringBoot Database - JPA and Spring Data (MySql Database)
  * Spring Boot Caching and Actuator
  * Scale Microservices using Spring Cloud (Kubernetes is not part of this course.
  * Spring AOP (Aspect Oriented Program)
  * Design Patterns in Microservices
  * Once this is made we need to deploy, which we will be doing using DOCKER, for hosting and running microservices in docker container
* Tool Requirements (All are open source only, none are paid tools)
  * JDK 17, Maven 3, Eclipse latest version or STS Tool Suite (Spring Tool Suite), MySQL 5.5
  * ActiveMQ - Message Broker, or Kafka (Streaming message)
  * PostMan (To Test Back end Rest Services)
  * Swagger (OpenAPI), Zipkin (API Tracing Libraries)
  * Docker (Supported by Linux Based OS/System) (Not usually supported in Windows, but you need to do by Virtual Box and inside install Ubuntu/Linux OS)
  * Sir has Google Cloud account, where he will host himself. He will setup virtual Machine there only, and install Docker there.
  * You can take free google cloud Free tier account, with 300$ free usage, 3 months free subsriptions. Take when docker class is started, that time you can do
  * Once you done with docker, then close/delete the instance else you will be charged.
* First three lectures will be only understanding the architecture, from fourth class we will doing hands-on code and practical.
* START with MICROSERVICES Architecture
  * Microservices Architecture: Small services (To achieve some business functionality).
  * So Previously: Like if we need to do some functionality, let's say we want to measure the distance between two places, then we make class and write functionality there
  * and other client will take the jar file of it and used it's functionality by keeping it in some central folder.
  * But NOW what we do is we make services and host it somewhere, and then other clients will just use our functionality by calling the services.
  * In jar client can know about whole code implementation, whereas in API the code are hidden from client.
  * APIs can be reachable only using Web/Internet, hence they are called web services.
  * Different way of Implementing WebServices: RESTful Web Services (We will be using this only) and SOAP based webservices. (HTTP is Protocol to connect Webservices)
  * Monolithic Architecture : All code services code in same project.
  * Microservices Architecture : Services are prepared separately in any code language, and connected by using webservices.
