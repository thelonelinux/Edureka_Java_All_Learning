# Edureka Microservices Certification Training Course

## Course Content: (Total 8 Modules, Sessions of 3 hours each)
### 1. Introduction to Microservices
* Class 1 Recording Learning
* Pre-requisites: Java
* So To Implement Microservices Architecture in our Project: We will be using the following tech Stacks
  * We will be doing practicals in Java and SpringBoot Framework (Basics of Core Java, Basics of Spring Framework like IOC Dependency Injection)
  * We will be dealing with RestFUL Web Services (Which will be using SpringBoot which in turn uses Spring MVC only)
  * SpringBoot Database - JPA and Spring Data (MySql Database)
  * Spring Boot Caching and Actuator
  * Scale Microservices using Spring Cloud (Kubernetes is not part of this course.
  * Spring AOP (Aspect Oriented Program)
  * Design Patterns in Microservices
  * Once this is made we need to deploy, which we will be doing using DOCKER, for hosting and running microservices in docker container
* Tool Requirements (All are open source only, none are paid tools)
  * JDK 17, Maven 3, Eclipse latest version or STS Tool Suite (Spring Tool Suite), MySQL 5.5
  * ActiveMQ - Message Broker, or Kafka (Streaming message)
  * PostMan (To Test Back end Rest Services)
  * Swagger (OpenAPI), Zipkin (API Tracing Libraries)
  * Docker (Supported by Linux Based OS/System) (Not usually supported in Windows, but you need to do by Virtual Box and inside install Ubuntu/Linux OS)
  * Sir has Google Cloud account, where he will host himself. He will setup virtual Machine there only, and install Docker there.
  * You can take free google cloud Free tier account, with 300$ free usage, 3 months free subsriptions. Take when docker class is started, that time you can do
  * Once you done with docker, then close/delete the instance else you will be charged.
* First three lectures will be only understanding the architecture, from fourth class we will doing hands-on code and practical.
