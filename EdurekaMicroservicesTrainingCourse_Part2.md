# This is continuation of EdurekaMicroservicesTrainingCourse.md

## 6.Microservices Security (Continued...)
## Starting from Lecture 6 Continued.
* From here we will be doing Ecommerce microservice implementation using Spring boot.
* ECommerce Application :
      * 1. Orders Microservice (Spring Boot Project)
          * Code Components: OrdersController, OrdersService, OrdersRepository. Similar code components we will have for below microservice spring boot projects also
      * 2. Product Microservice (Spring Boot Project)
      * 3. Customer Microservice (Spring Boot Project)
      * 4. Inventory Microservice (Spring Boot Project)
  * So for this 4 spring boot projects we will have 4 spring boot servers running this project. So this is the building block of microservices.
  * In production, we need to scale(expanding to larger way) these microservices. So for that we need below patterns tools.
      1. service registration and discovery
      2. service or client side load balancing
      3. resiliency using / circuitbreaker
      4. monitoring with spring boot actuator, micrometer and prometheus
      5. API tracing with Zipkin and spring cloud sleuth
      6. Spring cloud config
      7. API Gateway with Spring Cloud gateway
      8. After completing the above items we will be doing => Spring Security (Basic Auth, OAuth2, JWT)

* We will be also doing DOCKER in our project, But kubernetes is not part of our syllabus. So whatever Kubernetes is providing , that we can find in Spring Cloud also.
* Next class we will start with Service Registration and Discovery
* --- END OF CLASS 6 -------


## 7.Docker with Microservices using Spring Boot - I
* Lecture 7 class starts
* 


## 8.Docker with Microservices using Spring Boot - II
## 9.Final Project (Here some additional classes were taken to complete the other topics of this Training)
