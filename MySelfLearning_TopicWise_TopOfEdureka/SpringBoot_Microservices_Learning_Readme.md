# SPRINGBOOT MICROSERVICES LEARNING - TOP OF EDUREKA LECTURES AND MY TOPICWISE/CODEWISE EACH CONCEPT LEARNING
* From Edureka we have learn two courses
  * 1. Edureka Java, J2EE, SOA, Spring and SpringBoot Basic
  * 2. Edureka SpringBoot Microservices
* So now we have watched most of lectures and start doing learning by having code example to understand better.
* We will learning mostly spring core related and mostly in spring boot concepts of microservices only using implementation of code.
* --- END ---

## EDUREKA COURSES RELATED TO JAVA AND  STUFFS
### 1. EDUREKA JAVA_J2EE_SOA_SPRING_PLUS
* See in folder in this repo in "Edureka_Java_J2EE_SOA_Spring_Plus"
* No more learning added in its readme. As we are mostly oriented towards basic of spring framework, spring core
* And then directly move to spring boot only. 
* J2EE and SOA are outdated tech stack as we have moved to SpringBoot and Microservices.

### 2. EDUREKA MICROSERVICES USING SPRINGBOOT
* See in folder in this repo in "Edureka_springBoot_Microservices"
* Some initial learning from lecture is added in its readme file, check there and you can understand the flow of lectures and what topics are included.
* We will learn every important topic related to Springboot and Microservices.
* PARALLELLY We will add in our major project in LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM for our full microservices learning. 
  * Here we learn topic and simple coding as one microservices, 
  * there in library management system github, there we will do full fledge in microservices level with multiple microservices in one.
* --- END ----



## MY LEARNING TOPIC WISE (INCLUDES SPRING CORE, IOC, DI, SPRING BOOT, MICROSERVICES)
* We will follow the edureka class only mostly, extra we will add on our own if we have to.
* Also first learn readme in each of edureka classes folders of java_j2ee and edureka springboot_microservices. To get idea where we are from class lectures.
