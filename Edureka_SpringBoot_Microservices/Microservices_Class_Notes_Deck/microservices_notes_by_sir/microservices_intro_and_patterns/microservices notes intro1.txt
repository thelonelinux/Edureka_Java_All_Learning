prerequiste for this course is java

Microservices is not language bound
it is technology agnostic

if we know solutions to build using microservices
we can use any programming language

we will see all practicals from java perspective

spring boot framework to implement microservices

spring boot framework --- core java basics -- prerequisite

                          basics of spring framework(ioc, di)--introduction on these
                          spring aop(aspect oriented programming)
                          spring mvc/spring rest -- i will give details on this
                          sprin data jpa -- database related(mysql database)_

                          Restful webservices-- 
                          spring boot caching
                          actuator

enhance this knowledge to start building microservices using springboot and scale these microservices
using spring cloud(service discovery, service load balancing(client side load balancing),
                       resiliency with circuitbreaker, api gateway, monitoring and api tracing,external config)

pivotal cloud foundry alternative to kubernetes uses spring cloud libraries

microservice security --- spring security basic auth, OAuth2, JWT

dockers --- how we will leverage docker containers for hosting and running microservices

atually it is 24 hrs course with 8 modules (each module is 3 hrs)
but from my 1st batch onwwards i did not completed this course in 24 hrs
33 hrs-35 hrs


1. JDK 17, spring boot 2.7.9
2. Maven 3
3. Eclipse latest version or STS(spring tool suite)
4. MySQL 5.5 or 8
5. Postman or Advanced Rest client tool(to test back end rest apis)
6. ActiveMQ--message broker, JMS based

Swagger/OpenAPI
Zipkin--api tracing library

till here i will be using my local system
******************

dockers -- supported by Linux 
            in windows, setup Virtual box and inside that you should install Ubuntu OS
                my own google cloud account
                i wll set up virtual machine with ubuntu OS and install docker engine

              google cloud free account --- 3 months free subscription with 300$ free usage
              AWS free trial -- raise support ticker to AWS that you are using for experimental and training purpose
