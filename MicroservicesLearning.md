# MICROSERVICES

## What is Microservices
* In short, the microservice architectural style is an approach to developing a single application as a suite of small services,
* each running in its own process and communicating with lightweight mechanisms, often an HTTP resource API.
* Microservices are a method of developing software applications which are made up of independently deployable, modular services
