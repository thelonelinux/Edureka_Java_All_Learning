# MICROSERVICES

## What is Microservices
* In short, the microservice architectural style is an approach to developing a single application as a suite of small services,
* each running in its own process and communicating with lightweight mechanisms, often an HTTP resource API.
* Microservices are a method of developing software applications which are made up of independently deployable, modular services

* This is helpful when there are huge requirements in your package, and requirements keep on changing during project development.
* So in this case monolithic approach fails and hence we have to go through Microservices way of building the project.
